# Classifying restaurants by state
In this work, we use the Yelp research dataset to train classical machine learning models and neural networks for the purpose of classifying the restaurants into two categories (Permenantly closed or Open). Furthermore, we use FP-Growth in order to determine the attributes (or characteristics) that affect the state of the restaurants in several areas of Montreal.
